This provides the source for an easy handling and maintaining Docker image of a [Red Eclipse](https://redeclipse.net/) Server.  
Currently the Docker images are build against the latest commits and will be checked for updates once a day.

---

## Images
Latest images are available at [Docker Hub][docker hub].  
Pull them with `docker pull iceflower/redeclipse-server:<tag>`.  
The `amd64` images are build with [Travis CI][travis ci]. The `arm64v8` images are build on an own server.

## Usage
Replace the variables with the respective values.

  - `<name>` a container name, under which it will run
  - `<tag>` an available image tag
  - `<serverport>` the serverport specified inside the `servinit.cfg` from your server
  - `<serverport + 1>` the serverport + 1  
  ***you can link host directories inside the docker container, if dont want to link a directory just leave off the specific `-v` parameter.***
  - `<re home dir>` RE home directory on your host system, **must linked**
  - `<re package dir>` package directory, mostly maps, on your host system
  - `<sauerbraten dir>` sauerbraten directory on your host system
  - `<log file>` log file on your host system

### Docker Compose (recommend)
- Create own Docker Compose file, as base you can use [docker-compose.yml.template](./docker-compose.yml.template)  
  - *Create a copy with name `docker-compose.yml`*
  - *Change all the `<variable>` inside the file, to their respective values*

- Pull latest docker image from Docker Hub for all defined services  
`docker-compose pull`

- Start/ Restart container (for all specified services, dont write any name)  
`docker-compose up -d <name> >> <log file>`

- Shutdown and wait a maximum of 10 seconds before forcing (for all specified services, dont write any name)  
`docker-compose stop <name>`

#### Multiple Server
Copy and paste the whole section below the point `services` and change the values. Then start it with the new other name.

#### Example
- Create own Docker Compose file, as base you can use [docker-compose.yml.template](./docker-compose.yml.template)  
[docker-compose.yml.example](./docker-compose.yml.example)

- Pull latest docker image from Docker Hub for all defined services  
`docker-compose pull`

- Start/ Restart container  
`docker-compose up -d re-dev-server >> /home/iceflower/re-server.log`

- Shutdown and wait a maximum of 10 minutes before forcing  
`docker-compose stop --time=600 re-dev-server`

### Command line
- Pull latest docker image from Docker Hub  
`docker pull iceflower/redeclipse-server:<tag>`

- Create container  
`docker create -p <serverport>:<serverport>/udp -p <serverport + 1>:<serverport + 1>/udp -v <re home dir>:/re-server-config/home -v <re package dir>:/re-server-config/package -v <sauerbraten maps dir>:/re-server-config/sauer --name <name> iceflower/redeclipse-server:<tag>`

- Start container  
`docker start <name> >> <log file>`

- Shutdown and wait a maximum of 10 seconds before forcing  
`docker stop <name>`

#### Multiple Server
Create a container, with changed values and another name and start it.

#### Example
- Pull latest docker image from Docker Hub  
`docker pull iceflower/redeclipse-server:master`

- Create container  
`docker create -p 28801:28801/udp -p 28802:28802/udp -v /home/iceflower/redeclipse-config/devel_home:/re-server-config/home -v /home/iceflower/redeclipse-config/package:/re-server-config/package -v /home/iceflower/redeclipse-config/sauerbraten:/re-server-config/sauer --name re-dev-server iceflower/redeclipse-server:master`

- Start container  
`docker start re-dev-server >> /home/iceflower/re-server.log`

- Shutdown and wait a maximum of 10 minutes before forcing  
`docker stop --time=600 re-dev-server`
