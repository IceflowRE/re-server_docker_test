This provides the source for an easy handling and maintaining Docker image of a [Red Eclipse](https://redeclipse.net/) Server.  
Additional with an python console application which can be run automatically to update the images.  
Currently the Docker images are build against the latest commits and will be checked for updates once a day.

---

## Images
Latest images are available at [Docker Hub][docker hub].  
Pull them with `docker pull iceflower/redeclipse-server:<tag>`. Use as tag `master` or `stable` (which are the latest commits of the branch) or use a specific version. The correct architecture will be chosen.  
The `amd64` images are build with [Travis CI][travis ci]. The `arm64v8` images are build on an own server.

|      Tag     |  RE Version | Architecture |               Build              |                  Size / Layers                |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| amd64-stable |      1.6    |     amd64    |  [![][travis stable]][travis ci] |     [![][mbadge stable]][mbadge stable l]     |
| arm64-stable |      1.6    |     arm64    |      [![][no build]][github]     | [![][mbadge arm stable]][mbadge arm stable l] |
| amd64-master | development |     amd64    | [![][travis master]][travis ci]  |     [![][mbadge master]][mbadge master l]     |
| arm64-master | development |     arm64    |      [![][no build]][github]     | [![][mbadge arm master]][mbadge arm master l] |

## Usage
Replace the variables with the respective values.

  - `<name>` a container name, under which it will run
  - `<tag>` an available image tag (either `master`, `stable-re2` or `stable`)
  - `<serverport>` the serverport specified inside the `servinit.cfg` from your server
  - `<serverport + 1>` the serverport + 1  
  ***you can link host directories inside the docker container, if dont want to link a directory just leave off the specific `-v` parameter.***
  - `<re home dir>` RE home directory on your host system, **must linked**
  - `<re package dir>` package directory, inside you can place a maps directory, on your host system
  - `<sauerbraten dir>` sauerbraten directory on your host system

### Docker Compose (recommend)
- Create own Docker Compose file, as base you can use [docker-compose.yml.template](./docker-compose.yml.template)  
  - *Create a copy with name `docker-compose.yml`*
  - *Change all the `<variable>` inside the file, to their respective values*

- Pull latest docker image from Docker Hub for all defined services  
`docker-compose pull`

- Start/ Restart container (for all specified services, dont write any name)  
`docker-compose -p re-server up -d <name>`

- Shutdown and wait a maximum of 10 seconds before forcing (for all specified services, dont write any name)  
`docker-compose stop <name>`

#### Multiple Server
Copy and paste the whole section below the point `services` and change the values. Then start it with the new other name.

#### Example
- Create own Docker Compose file, as base you can use [docker-compose.yml.template](./docker-compose.yml.template)  
[docker-compose.yml.example](./docker-compose.yml.example)

- Pull latest docker image from Docker Hub for all defined services  
`docker-compose pull`

- Start/ Restart container  
`docker-compose -p re-server up -d master`

- Shutdown and wait a maximum of 10 minutes before forcing  
`docker-compose stop --time=600 master`

## Updater and Webhook listener
