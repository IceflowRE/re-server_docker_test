This provides a Dockerfile for an easy handling and maintaining of a [Red Eclipse](https://redeclipse.net/) Server.
Currently the Docker images are build against the latest commits and will be checked for updates once a day.

## Images
Latest images are available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/iceflower/red-eclipse_devel_server_test/).
Pull them with `docker pull iceflower/red-eclipse_devel_server_test:<tag>`.

### Tags
|       Tag      | Server type | Architecture |
|:--------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
|     master     | development |     amd64    |
| arm64v8-master | development |    arm64v8   |
|     stable     |    stable   |     amd64    |
| arm64v8-stable |    stable   |    arm64v8   |
